# Retrospective voting (RV)

> Voters hold govts accountable for their performance in office.
> They reward good outcomes and sanction poor outcomes. (Fiorina 1981)

- Widespread evidence of RV  
  - Ubiquitous if variable (Healy & Malhotra 2009)
  - Causal arrow from attitude to vote (e.g., Lenz 2012, Hart & Middleton 2015)  
  
- Normative ambiguity (Achen & Bartels 2016)  
  - Myopic judgments (Healy & Lenz 2014)
  - Cannot parse competence from luck (Huber et al. 2012) 

---
# Unexplored microfoundations  
### Can subjects differentiate competent from incompetent incumbents?  

- Retrospective voting *requires*
  - **Integration** over stream of performance info
  - **Appraisal** of impression
  
- But I/A largely unseen
  - Uncommon focus of theory
  - Obs & Exp limitations


---
# Past experiments short-circuit I/A

&nbsp;
<blockquote>
Experts say that not only have economic conditions deteriorated a lot over the last year, but the British economy is doing considerably worse that most other countries.

</blockquote>

- Vignette provides 
  - pre\-integrated summary
  - explicit appraisal cue  
  
- Have yet to study I/A in controlled setting

# Experimental framework

.pull-left-1[

- Monitor new worker
- Vote to reappoint/replace
- Bonus $\propto$ factory output
- Worker is fully\-trained but 
  - Type unknown, <br> $\mu_{inc} \sim U(950,1450)$
  - Output variable, <br> $Y_{inc,t} \sim N(\mu_{inc},250^2)$

# Capacity and bias in I/A

&nbsp;

### Exp 1: Can voters identify competence in variable stream?
### Exp 2: Preference for stable performers?
### Exp 3: Over-punish negative outcomes?
### Exp 4: Judging performance myopically?

# Confronting spillover in I/A

&nbsp;

### Exp 5: Extract competence from confounded stream?
### Exp 6: Recognize relevant (ignore irrelevant) info?
### Exp 7: Complex confounding  
### Exps 8-9: Info search and provision 
### Exps 10-11: Benchmark quality and complexity

# Strategies for managing spillover

- Blind retrospection (Achen & Bartels 2016)  
  - No accounting for spillover
  - RV as myopic, indiscriminant displacement

- Rational discounting (Duch & Stevenson 2008) 
  - Voters discount by variance of spillover
  - RV as sophisticated signal extraction
  
- Benchmark comparison (Kayser & Peress 2012)  
  - Competence in relative performance gap
  - RV as low-info "social comparison"

# External validity and experimental design

### RCT as "standard" 

### Impact-estimating vs Theory-testing inquiry

### Evaluating "synthetic" designs for theory testing

# Synthetic experiments and generalization

# Rethinking generalizability

- The RCT sets the standard  
  - Eliminate lab--field distinction (Green & Gerber 2003)  
  - Generalize from lab conditional on realism (Findley et al. 2021)  

- Generalization beyond local impact
  - Populations, Treatments, Outcomes, Contexts (Egami & Hartman 2023)
  - Uncovering general tendencies
  - Testing/advancing theory
  
- Parallelism of experiment...
  - cannot establish external validity
  - may limit, rather than strictly enhance, external validity

# Intent and design

- Exp should mimic the target of generalization

# Criteria for external validity

### in 'synthetic' experiments for testing theory

- Setup
  - Identify theory testing as central goal
  - Ground generalization in theory
  - Specify models & *a priori* propositions under study  

- Design
  - Exp "world" captures only essential essence of the models
  - Creates space for contested behaviors to emerge
  - Experimental realism

# Quality Control and psychology of retrospection 
  
- *Can* voters hold governments accountable? **YES**
  - Capacity well beyond blind retrospection
  - Strategic, imperfect benchmarking 

- *Do* voters hold governments accountable? **maybe...**
  - Update models to reflect capacity 
  - Consider why it might/might not appear in practice

- Next steps  
  - Appraise first, integrate later
  - Locating negativity bias
